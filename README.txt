This project is an implementation of the popular Connect4 game. It starts with a 
definition of the game board using a 2D Array. Then methods that check for a vertical,
horizontal, and diagonal 4-in-a-row are implemented, and used for a winningState method
that will tell you if the game has been won by either the human or the AI. This method is
then used for a keepPlaying method that is used in a loop to keep the game going until
someone has won. userPlay and aiPlay methods are implemented to change the state of the
board. The AI is largely run by a loop that checks combinations of 3, 2, and 1 pieces
adjacent to one another. It will play a piece depending one the best move it can get. Once
the game has ended, the results and move list will show and the program will end.
